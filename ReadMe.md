# General Assembly Homework 4 - Trulia BnB - Modal

  

Homework assignment #4 for General Assembly's Front End Web Development Boot Camp. The assignment was to 
-   Learn about refactoring and how developers refactor their applications.
-   Add a new feature to Homework 3, which you completed last week.
-   Introduce a new UI pattern: a modal window.

-   Think of the modal window as another layer on top of the page.
-   The **position** property puts the modal on top of the page’s content.
-   Remember, **position** pops the element out of the typical DOM rendering position (this forces us to position it manually — we want a fixed position).
